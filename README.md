# Datacamp_competition

Which songs are most suitable for a dancing party? is the question that I try to answer in this Datacamp project. After comparing 5 machine learning model performances,I identify the proper one to predict the danceability level of a song. At the end of the project, I use this model to predict the top 50 of more danceable songs.
